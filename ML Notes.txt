ML Notes

Lexalytics
For Supervised Learning
Tokenization
	Use white space to define word
Pats of Speech Tagging
	Recognize Named Entities, extract themes and process sentiment
Named Entity Recognition
	Main use of POS
Sentiment
	
Classification

For Unsupervised Learning
Concept Matrix 
	whats closed to or not
Syntax Matrix
	the most likely parsing of a sentence
In a sentence 
	–


Hybrid model
Every ML method is aligned with patterns and rules of the language. 

Low-Level:
Tokenization: ML + Rules 
PoS Tagging: Machine Learning 
Chunking: Rules 
Sentence Boundaries: ML + Rules 
Syntax Analysis: ML + Rules 
Mid-Level:
Entities: ML + Rules to determine “Who, What, Where” 
Themes: Rules “What’s the buzz?” 
Topics: ML + Rules “About this?” 
Summaries: Rules “Make it short” 
Intentions: ML + Rules “What are you going to do?” 
Intentions uses the syntax matrix to extract the intender, intendee, and intent 
We use ML to train models for the different types of intent 
We use rules to whitelist or blacklist certain words 
Multilayered approach to get you the best accuracy 
High-Level:
Apply Sentiment: ML + Rules “How do you feel about that?



Notes on Machine Learning Fundamentals

10-12 hours per week

Use of nearest neighbour with 3.08% error rate
to find handwritter numbers
mentioned of training data as 10-cross-validation
(=divide training data)

use of structures to reduce k-NN search

distance functions
Lp norms
Metric spaces

	
Lp norms
	L1 = (manhatan distance)
	L2 = eucledian distance
	Linfinty = max point distance

Metric functions properties
