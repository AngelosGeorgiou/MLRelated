Generative Approach to Classification

	πi = Pr(y = i) 	[probability of class i]  Σπι = 1
	Pi(x)			[probability of x's label is i]

	Joint distribution Pr(x,y) = Pr(y)Pr(x|y) = πyPy(x)
	For new x we pick the largest label

Probability Review I
	Probability spaces
	Bayes' rule

Generative Modeling in One Dimension
	wine example
		calculate π
		13 features (13 dimensions) [advanced]
		for now we pick 1 feature, create the histogram, find median and variance. Then create Gaussian N(μ,σ^2) for each label
		use Bayes' rule two classify
